1.)

collection is a gorup references to store homoginious and hetroginous element.

hirarchy of collection is 


Iterable --> extends-->collection--> extends --->list implements  array list,LinkedList.
						collection--> extends --->set implemenrts Hash Set,LinkedHashSet,treeSet.
						collection--> extends --->queue implements LinkedList.
						
						
						
main Interfaces is  collection
collection extends List and set and queue

main diffrence is collection have some methods add(),remove(),size(),isempty,set,
other implements have same methods with additional methods 

List  						    					set

it allows Duplicate         			 does not  allows Duplicate
List is index based						set is not index based
it is positional acces					it does not positional access
it is maintain insertion order			does not maintain insertion order.
contines irteretor methods				does not contian  irteretor methods




2).
Map is a group of references which the form of to store key,And Values, of every entry.

Map interface having 5 implements 

HashMap,HashTable,treeMap,LinkedHashMap,Properties.



3.)				 Hashmap     					           						treeMap

	HashMap contains value based on the key.						TreeMap also contains value based on the key.
	It may have a single null key and multiple null values.			TreeMap is sorted by keys.
	HashMap does not maintain order while iterating.				It contains unique elements
	It contains unique elements.									It cannot have a null key but have multiple null values.
	it works on the principle of hashing.							Keys are in ascending order.
	
	
	
4.)   hash map implementation of hashCode() is because there is not any direct method in java to  reference of the object


6.) 
streem<String> name  =streem.of("vinoda");

name.streem.map(e->e.ToCharAT()).foreach(e->system.out.println(e));


7.)splietitor is a  interface in java splictor method introduced in java 8


8.)String operetions in streem is:

	
	start with 
	ends withto lowercase
	contains
	equals
	isupper
	islower
	
	
	
9.) Spring is a open source framework it provide managing a object it sopport developing application.


10.)Dependency injection is a reference of object  to spring framework
to achive using @autowired and associte with component


11.)
bean inject using spring bean content above bean menction @bean  using autowired above property or constructor or setter method

two ways to inject bean 

constructor based bean injectionsetter based injection


12
yes more than one configuration have spring but menction exclude the classes

Spring ComponentScan(Basepackage ="com.xworkz.vinoda" excludefilters={@componentScan.filter={configuration classs and componentclasses}});



13).
string builder 

string builder is synchronized
String Builder side thread is safe
String Builder lowest performance comparing String Buffer

String Buffer
string Buffer is not synchronized
String buffer side  thread is not safe
String Buffer Hoghest performance comparing String Builder

14.) 


BeanFactory


Beanfactory is used to validation purpose to used

Application Context

it used to Creating instance and managing a spring 


15.)
1  Spring Aop

Spring Aop is stand for ASPECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING  

2) Ioc is Inversion Of Control  it is used to managing a spring object

3).POJO


POJO stand for Plain Old Java Object it is nothing special it has Property Getter And Setter Methos of POJO.



4)
@component 

it Creatring And Managing A spring  Object
5)ComponentScan 

it is a scan base package contains Components of a Spring 

6@Bean 

@bean object managed By A Spring 



16.) 
Map<String ,int> Entrys=New HashMap<String ,int>();
put("India" ,91);
put("CHINA" ,126);
put("USA" ,081);
put("CANADA" ,121);
put("BANGLADESH" ,120);

Set<Entry<String ,int>> ref=Entrys.entityset();

ref.streem.foreach(e->system.out.println(e->e.getkey+""+e.values));

ref.Streem.filter(e->e.getKey("India")).remove().foreach(e->system\.out.println(e->e.getKey+""+e.values));



17).

1 Meven 
it is used to creating meven project and add And Download the dependency;

3Tomcat tomcat is a server it is used to run a web applications on the server.

4. Qurcus

Qurcus is used to spring is valaditing a properties;

5 SonarQube 
SonarQube is used to To cheak Code is industry standres maching or not

6. Server


Server is a service to operetion on request and response the service ;


20

Collection <int> element=new LinkedList<int>();
element.add(10);
element.add(50);
element.add(40);
element.add(30);
element.add(20); 

element.remove(0,10);
element.remove(5,20);
