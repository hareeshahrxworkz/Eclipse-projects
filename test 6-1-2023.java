3  Converting a subclass type into a superclass type is called Generalization
	Converting  subclasses from an existing class.
	
	
4 a)stop a class to extended inherited by other classes make  class constructor private.


 
b)java.lang.String, java.lang.Math are final classes.


c) Delegation is an alternative to inheritance. Delegation means instance of another class as an instance variable,

Collection used for Comparetor Sorted  and Comparable

Linked List 												Array List

Slower for reading data	node							faster for reading data elements
faster for manuplating data								slower for manuplating data
it is use  node 										it is use index
internally used circlur 								internaly uses arrays

List itreretor   											iteretor
list iteretor is accessing element 				iteretor it uses only forword direction accesing element
from forword and backword 

list iteretor it used in  priviousNext()		iteretor is used to hasnext(),remove(),next()
next(),peiviousindex(),next index 	

It helps traverse through a list only. 			It helps traverse through a map,
												list and a set.	
												
The iterator canâ€™t modify or replace 			It can traverse through the elements present in Collection.
elements of a Collection.

memory likeage in java is one instance pointing to reference to the memory  is pointing to another memory location 
memory leakage like garbage collector
